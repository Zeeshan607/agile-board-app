- Description

    My first SERN(using MySQL as Database) stack app. its just basic clone of Trello [https://trello.com/]
    but in my own design and way of coding. I am developing this to understand how NODE.js and express.js, 
    works with Database technologies like MYSQL, MongoDB to develop backend API for a REACT app. 

    - First tried MongoDB it was easy, then i feel that is should use MYSQL so i am using Sequalize v6
