- Current Status
    Under Development 

- Note:
    you will find my git commits messages little bit lengthy. this is because its my first MERN stack project and I trying to document my experience, 
    while building every module and functionality. I am doing a lot of things for first time and learning a lot.

-  Project Description

    My first SERN(using MySQL as Database) stack app. its just basic clone of Trello [https://trello.com/]
    but in my own design and way of coding. I am developing this to understand how NODE.js and express.js, 
    works with Database technologies like MYSQL, MongoDB to develop backend API for a REACT app. 

    - First tried MongoDB it was easy, then i feel that is should use MYSQL so i am using Sequalize v6
